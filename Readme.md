#Tic Tac Toe

#Installation

This is a basic Tic Tac Toe game implemented in React Native with Expo.
We are utilizing **npx** to use Expo CLI without installation.
Complete installation and running the app guide is available [here][https://docs.expo.dev/get-started/installation/]

First of all, you need [Expo Go][https://expo.dev/client] app downloaded on your mobile.

##yarn install

You might need to do a yarn install when download the project.

##npx expo start

This should start the metro server. It will give you a bar code or a URL.
You can use the Expo Go app to scan the bar code and the app should now be up and running.
